I used `flask`, `flask-sqlalchemy`, `flask-marshmallow`, `marshmallow-sqlalchemy`, `python-dotenv`,`codemirror` and `sculpt` to build this project.
This project was built in a pipenv environment. So you will need pipenv install the dependencies.

To run, go to the challenge directory and enter:

`pipenv shell` This creates the virtual environment

`pipenv install` This installs all the dependencies

`flask run` This runs the website locally

The project initially starts with 2 questions. If the server stops running, restarting the server will recreate the 2 initial questions but wipe the rest of the data.

This project contains some CRUD applications that include `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

Unfortunately, there are still many things that need to be worked on in the project. But with more time, I can definitely complete this task.
